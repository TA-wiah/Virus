Project Name: Blackout Virus

Creator: CyberHatcher (Jeffrey)

Description:
The Blackout Virus is a work-in-progress project designed by CyberHatcher with the main purpose of temporarily rendering a PC inoperable until a specific key is pressed to restart it. Once activated, the virus will induce a blackout state on the system, effectively disabling its functions until the user intervenes by pressing a designated key to restart it.

Usage Instructions:
Initiate Blackout:

Upon execution, the virus will initiate a blackout on the system, disabling its functions.
Restart System:

To restart the system and restore its functionality, the user must press the designated restart key (N).
Terminating the Virus:

To terminate the virus and end the blackout cycle, the user must press the designated quit key (M).
Recurring Cycle:

If the system is not restarted within 3 minutes, the blackout will persist, creating a recurring blackout cycle until the user intervenes.
